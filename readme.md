# Material Design Viewctrls
My viewctrls project (link) is something I use at work for simple little, out-of-the-way controls in our views. It's still a pretty imperative programming environment (we're working on that...), so tossing some controls in the upper right is convenient.

Also, since it's primarily for work (as of now), I'm not bothering with a build step (Babel); the browsers all support ES2015.

This depends on jQuery and jQuery UI's widget factory (as of now).
